Krazykirby99999 has been experimenting with code since 2016. Below you may find information about some of his projects that are either complete or still being improved.

* [Flashmath1][flashmath1-link], a flash/html5 game website. Used by over 8 million since its start in the February of 2018.
* [MCC Modloader][mccmodloader-link], a modloader for the PC release of Halo MCC. Abandoned shortly after development began due to superior alternatives becoming available.
*[ASCII-RPG][ascii-rpg-link], a template for ascii games in python. A work in progress.
